                <p>Without a doubt second-hand shops have always been considered cheap and student friendly, however Reuse has taken it to a whole-nother level. As you might’ve figured out from the subtitle, it’s free, making it even more appealing for us poor students. “But Simon, what’s the catch?”, honestly there’s no catch, it’s only an option to bring stuff yourself. </p>

                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>Every morning new (yet old) stuff is brought to the store and packed out right before opening time. The stuff is from other second-hand shops that considered the items too hard to sell again (They certainly don’t know a lot of students). That isn’t to say they don’t get a lot of stuff from customers too, in fact about 40% of what you’ll find there is from other people. With the amount of items brought in each morning there’s also the largest amount of people during the morning (because that’s when you’ll find the best stuff). But, there’ll still be a hidden gem or two there by the end of the day for the keen-eyed. </p>

                    <h2>Location and facility</h2>
                    <p>The shop is placed in Aarhus K – which is by Godsbanen. It’s located fairly far away from the other facilities there though, meaning if you wanted to, you’d have to walk about 4 minutes to get there from the K section. But the shop has a huge parking area, and by huge I mean extremely huge (130+ cars). This allows for anybody to both park and drive like an idiot without any real consequence. Seeing as a large part of the items are chairs and furniture, it’s probably a good idea to bring a car. 
Overall Reuse is great for students, but it demands you to be on your toes. </p>
