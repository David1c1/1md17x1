            <h2>Most commen item in stores</h2>
            <p>The wooden spoon or as they call it in danish “Træske”, is probably the most commen item you’ll find in any second-hand shop here in Denmark.<br>
It’s been used since the dark ages (if not earlier) and it still serves it’s purpose here 1000 years later.</p>

            <h2>Pricing in second-hand stores</h2>
            <p>
Most people that go to second-hand stores would probably argue that they have a sense of pricing in the store if not just for special parts of it.<br>
But what of those whom find it hard to decide rather or not the pricing is high or low in a special shop.</p>

            <h2>Mass production</h2>
            <p>Træsken (wooden spoon) was mass produced during the late 1800 and early 1900 and have ever since been produced heavily.<br>
Due to it’s practical look, useful function and cheap martial. It’s held in high regard to most danes.</p>

        <h2>Deciding pricing based on a spoon</h2>
        <p>For us who find it somewhat difficult there’s a simple solution. Find a wooden spooon (the size you’d use for steering in a soup)<br>
Once you’ve found it, act as if you want to buy it - then based on that price you’ll find out how badly priced things are in the shop</p>

        <h2>Types of spoons</h2>
        <p>With the amount of spoons produced there’s also bound to be many types of them as well, in fact some are rare and vaulable.<br>
Cooking and steering spoons are most commen, but eating spoons are rare and considered neat, they might fetch a good hagling price.</p>
