                <p>Place where creativity meets with the passion for food - That’s <a href="https://www.aarhusstreetfood.com/"> <strong>Street food</strong> </a> </p>
          
          <p> <strong> One of the places… <br></strong>
Being in the new city you are looking for SPOTS. And by spots I mean extraordinary locations to spend free time. Where atmosphere is relaxing and just good.<br> </p> 
              <p>
But where better you can spend some time rather than with FOOD? <br>
              
Located in the city centre in Aarhus,  magical and awesome place to eat, drink and what’s the most important  hang out with friends.  Basically, being there you won’t escape from people, because that’s  melting pot  and cradle of food coming from all around the world. <br> English Fish and Chips, Italian Carboarra, French Crepes, Indian Curry, Thai Pad thai, American Burger, Spanish Tapas, Mexican Nachos and even  more all together gathered under one roof.  

</p>
          
            <p>For those who don’t know what idea of the street food is… <br> 
 Street food is ready-to-eat food or drink sold by a hawker, or vendor, in a street or other public place, such as at a market or fair. It is often sold from a portable food booth, food cart, or food truck and meant for immediate consumption. <br>
                  Great idea if you in a hurry right? 
</p>        
          <p> Eating “on the street”  is  famous worldwide due to few reasons.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>
              •	people usually don’t have got time to prepare meals
              </li>
              <li>•	 it’s the best option for travellers to try local cuisine  </li>
              <li>•	and the most important- it’s cheap</li>
            
              </ul>
       
              <p> In Aarhus you have got possibility to get to know street food better. Big hall, full of trailers 
where you  can feel like in street food heaven or  even walking hungry without idea what to eat you always find something for yourself! </p>
                  
<p> As student you will probably be like “ okay okay, slow down a little bit. Sounds interesting buuut I am poor. Can I afford it?” <br>
The answer is simple.  Sure you can.
