     <p> If you usually think about  cheap food, first thing that comes to your mind is probably <strong> FAST FOOD</strong> .
Fast foods are serving  not only cheap but also really really tasty food. As kids all of us felt excited when mom or dad agreed on buying a  <strong> HAPPY MEAL</strong>.  But  still, one of the biggest problem with them is that they are not healthy. I mean you are not going to die after eating one cheeseburger but if you don’t have time it may become your daily routine.

            <p> Especially if you are a student. <br>
Especially if you are an International Student. <br>
                Especially if you are an International Student in Denmark.<img src="images/flag-round-250.png" alt="flag" class="flag"> <br> </p>

<a href="http://www.visitaarhus.com/ln-int/denmark/tourist-in-aarhus"> <strong>Aarhus</strong></a> - one of the biggest cities in Denmark. Capital of culture in 2017 and what is the most important - Denmark’s best education city. Which of course include students  from all around the world. 
</p>
          <p> As an international student every day is a struggle. The biggest  insecurity is for sure lack of money. That’s pretty obvious. When next weeks fly by  we all are getting  used to it. But the real question is <br> 
<strong> Can you at the same time eat good and cheap food? </strong>
</p>
            <p>Sure, you can. Only thing you need is willingness. Put some effort into this. Not only treat food like something necessary to survive but in fact pretty nice part of the  day. 
                In Aarhus, on probably every street you can find a shop. Perfect place to do everyday groceries.  Walking around the city you can see <a href="https://fakta.dk/"><strong>Fakta</strong></a>,<a href="https://www.foetex.dk/?cmpid=aw_brand_02040201023600000000&gclid=CPrv2tu249YCFcG87QodwdkARA"><strong>Fotex</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.lidl.dk/da/index.htm"><strong>Lidl</strong></a>, <a href=" https://netto.dk/"><strong>Netto</strong></a>, <a href="https://kvickly.dk/?gclid=CMWF2Na349YCFYW87QodaSUEAw"><strong>Kvickly</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REMA_1000"><strong>Rema 1000</strong></a>  or one of the most popular in the whole wide world <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Eleven"><strong>7/11</strong></a>. Which one is the cheapest?  Student as student always has got tactics. Each of them ( excluded 7/11) have got its goods. And by goods I mean <strong>budget food</strong>.
