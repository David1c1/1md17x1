          <section> 
          <p> Tofu, Soya, Vegan burger and all of the “V” products always sounds pretty interesting.
              
But how to find them in the country where everything is quite expensive? <br>
 How to stay on the green side without money? <br>
How to deal with being vege and international student at the same time? <br> 
The best answers you can get from the source, that’s why this article looks different. Welcome to <strong>THE INTERVIEW!</strong> 
</p> </section> 
      
          <p> Two answering questions international, creative and very positive students. </p> <br>
 <h1> K and R</h1> <br>
          
          
          <p>Let the Q and A's begin! </p> <section>
          
          <p> <strong> Vegetarian or Vegan?</strong> <br>
          
          <strong>K:</strong> I am vegetarian but i am planning to become vegan in the future.  But for instance I haven’t drank milk for around two years from now and I don’t eat cheese ore yogurts. Only  on pizza but very rarely, so I am trying to limit dairy.
              
              
              <br>
              <strong>R:</strong> That’s a bit hard to say, since I don’t like to be limited in any way. So I am open to eat anything, but on daily basis, especially when I prepare the food myself, I eat mostly vegan. <br> 
            
          </p></section> 
          <section>
          <p> <strong> How long are you v?</strong> <br>
              
          <strong>K:</strong>: I started with quiting drinking milk about 2 years ago. Then I was gradually eating less cheese, until I stopped completely for some time. Around Christmas 2017 I deciced to quit eating meat, but before that, I was eating just chicken, so it wasn't hard at all. I haven't eaten meat since that, but I started eating dairy again from time to time. <br>
              <strong>R:</strong>  with some breaks, it will be almost three years since I am eating this way. <br>
          </p> </section>
          <section>
          <p> <strong>Do you think being vegan/ vegetarian is cheaper or more expensive?</strong> <br> 
              <strong>K:</strong>It depends where do you live. Also just to make things clear, you can be vegan by just eating bread with jam everyday. In that case, it would be cheaper, obviously. But that's something you shouldn't be doing. You need to make sure your diet is balanced. Of course that's also true for non-vegetarians.
So let's say you really want to eat healthy and be vegan here in Denmark. Then I would say it can be more expensive, especially when you like to eat out. Also it's really hard to find some meat replacement like soya or tofu or hummus, whereas in Poland things like that where available in the most popular and cheapest supermarket. It also depends if you're buying ready meals or preparing some things for yourself. If I would like to buy hummus here it would be more expensive, that's why I make my own. <br> 

              <strong>R:</strong>That depends on the actual food choices, but it can be actually cheaper! <br>
          </p> </section>
          <section> 
              <p> <strong> Do you consider vege things more expensive here than in your country? </strong>  <br>
              <strong>K:</strong>Yes.
Much more and harder to find.
<br> 
              <strong>R: </strong>I am not a big fan of soya products, so I can’t really say about the ‘vegan’ labeled products. To be, eating vegan is more about grains, fruit and vegetable. However, the prices are overall higher here in Denmark, especially when it comes to fresh fruit and veggies. <br>
          
          </p> </section>
          <section> <p> <strong> What tou usually eat when you don’t have to worry about prcies (for example  in your country)? </strong><br> 
           <strong> K: </strong>I love vegan burgers. When I've been to opener festival this year I bought them everyday. There's one vegan fast-food cain called Krowarzywa. <br> 
              <strong> R:</strong> Back home I always surround myself with lot of fresh fruit and greens, which I use to make salads and smoothies. That would be very expensive here in Denmark, so for economical reasons, I am eating more grains—such as oats, rice or buckwheat<br>
          </p> 
              </section>
          <section><p> <strong> How are you feeling like v student? Is that hard?  </strong> <br> 
              <strong> K:</strong> It was hard in the beginning, when I had to figure out how to adapt my diet to danish conditions, where to find the ingredients I usually use, what to actually cook <br> 
              <strong> R:</strong> I feel awesome! I think that eating vegan makes my life as a student much easier. For instance, cooking meat takes up quite a lot of type, my vegan meals are done in few minutes <br> 
              
              </p></section>
          <section> <p>  <strong>Have you got your favourite place to buy? (bread ,vegetables , fruits, grains…)  and have you found here in Aarhus some good cheap products?</strong> <br>
              <strong> K: </strong>I usually buy at fakta, because it's the nearest shop for me, and you can find plant "milk" there or even tofu (which is expensive). I think that chickpeas are cheaper than in Poland and more available, I buy them to make hummus, also baked beans with tomato sauce are very cheap and if you spice them up they can be really tasty, another thing is dark packed bread and also I love mixed froxen vegetables you can find  also in fakta <br>
              <strong>R:</strong> Near my place there is a big arabic market called Bazar Vest. I have never seen so much fruit in my life! You can get very exotic fruit for incredibly low prices there. Plus, the whole shopping experience feels more authentic than in a supermarket. <br>

          <section> <p>  <strong> Have you got your favourite dinner?</strong> <br>
              <strong> K: </strong>I have my 2 go to dishes
One of them is potato-carrot soup and second, vegetables with rice or pasta.
 <br>
              <strong>R:</strong> It’s hard to pick one particular dish, but recently I really like this thai sweet potato soup <br>
              
              </p></section>
          
        
          <section> <p>  <strong> One more question, is there any tips/ advices you can give us?</strong> <br>
              <strong> K: </strong> Bananas are very gud! <br>
              <strong>R:</strong>Eat bananas! <br>
That's all I can say  <br>
