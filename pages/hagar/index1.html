          <p>Web design governs all aspects involved with the visual aesthetics and usability of a website; such as color schemes, layouts, information flow.</p>
            <h3>A web designer :-</h3>
          
            <ul>
            <li>must always begin by considering a client’s website objectives and then move on to an Information Architecture (IA) </li> 
<li>uses graphics and graphic design software (think Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign) to create an interface for the web</li>
<li>Should be concerned with what the users see on their computer screens or mobile devices through the use of color, images, typography and layout.</li>
<li>can start with creating wireframes and finally move to the design stage.</li>
<li>Should use several basic design principles to achieve an aesthetically pleasing layout while offering excellent user experience and high quality.</li>
<li>Might not always be the person writing the code and in some cases he can work independently of the team that takes a website design live.</li>
<li>May continue his/her education in a variety of fields, but are most commonly drawn to graphic design and arts.</li>
            </ul>

Web development governs all the code that makes a website tick.

          <h3>Web developers:-</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Are sometimes called programmers.</li>
              <li>	Skills from technical ability and thinking to logic are essential part of their repertoires. Thus, they are often thought of as “left-brained workers”.</li>
              <li>Are further split into two sub-categories; front-end developers, and back-end developers.</li>
              <li>	Front-end developers as the connection between both web designers and back-end developers. That is due to the fact they have a little knowledge of both.</li>
              <li>	Typically will focus on the front end programming of a site using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, while other developers will focus on server side programming like PHP, Java, Ruby, and .NET.</li>
              
            </ul>
