                <h1> EDUCATION IN FINLAND</h1>
                <h2>-Why is Finland "on top" ?-</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <h3>Finland is in the top of many aspects of life. Their education is one of the best in the whole world, so let’s see what’s so special about this country.</h3><br>
                        <p><b>You have 9 years of compulsory education.</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>primary school - 6 years</li>
                        <li>high school - 3 years</li>
                        <li>upper secondary school, where you can choose if you want to go to <i>trade school</i> or <i>gymnasium school</i>(when you’re 16) - for 3 years</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <div class="red">
                        <h4><b>Different types of schools.</b></h4>
                        <p>Gymnasium has a lot of theory (mostly science) and the Vocational school is where you choose a trade (mechanic, cook, hair dresser, banking etc.)
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Finnish school vs Swedish school. Before starting school, when you’re<i> 7 years old</i>, you can choose between going to a Finnish school or a Swedish school. If you’re going to a Swedish school, you have all your subjects in Swedish. In the 3rd grade you start reading in finish, then in the 4th grade you start reading in English. In the high school you need to pick another language (ex. German, Spanish etc.).
                            <br><br>If you’re going to a Finnish school, you have all your subjects in Finnish. When you’re in the 4th grade you start reading in Swedish and in the 5th grade you start reading in English. In high school, the Finnish school will be divided. If you’re having both parents speak Finnish, you study a higher level of the language.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Equality.</b> Every school is the same, so there are no better schools. Also, they don’t have private schools.</p><br>
                    <p><b>No money.</b> The school is free, also you get free meals and the food is very good.</p><br>
                    <p><b>They don’t have an exam at the end of 12 years of education</b> (only at the end of high school if you want to go at a gymnasium school.)</p><br>
                    <p><b>Evaluation.</b> Usually, during the upper secondary school you have different courses and you have tests after every course, thus you can gain points. At the end of the year you have a massive project and the points from that will add to the average made from the tests during the year.</p><br>
                    <div class="red">
                        <h4><b>“Leveling up”.</b> </h4>
                        <p>Going from primary school to high school does not require an actual exam, but every test you take during the program will cont. If you fail a test, you can take it again, but if you fail the whole subject, they might ask you to redo the year.</p><br>
                        <h4><b>Internship.</b></h4>
                        <p> During the upper secondary school they have to take an internship. It depends on the program how long it should be. It can be every year for 2-4 months, or just 5 months in 3 years of studying.</p><br>
                        <h4><b>Military.</b></h4>
                        <p>All boys that turn 18 years old must go to military. You can choose to not go to the military, but then you must work for free for the government for 1 year (ex. day care, clean the streets etc.). Most guys go to the military and you’re there for either 6 months or 1 year, but that depends on what you choose to do during the military. (ex. a driver, a snipper, a marine etc.)</p>
