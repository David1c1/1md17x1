          <p>The most amazing sights,places and landmarks any student from around the world should come, see and visit are our Deer Park, Aros Museum and the Old Town Aarhus.</p>
          <p>South of the Aarhus city, in the Thors woods which are part of the larger Marselisborg-Moesgaard forest, lies the Deer Park. The area houses a wonderful population of sika and fallow deer which you can get really close-up to. The wild boars live in their own enclosures.</p>
          <P>ARoS Aarhus Art Museum is one of Europe’s largest art museums situated in the heart of Aarhus. ARoS is a house of art where guests can be pleased, enlightened and challenged. The architecture is of international class. The same is the art it's beautiful and mesmerizing.</P> 
          <p>The 'Den Gamle By' (The Old Town) is perfectly unique attraction in Aarhus for anybody to go on a fascinating journey back in history. Here you will meet people dressed and acting as folk at the end of the 19th century, and also as how people lived and worked in 1927. You can also take a walk through a town district from 1970s' Denmark, complete with streets, townhouses, shops, backyards, and workshops re-erected exactly as they stood in the past.</p>

        <h2>Keeping an animal while being a student</h2>

          <p>For some students, daily life involves being around a pet or pets.</p>
          <p>Going away to college is the start of a grand adventure. For many students, it may be the first time they will be spending long periods of time away from home and family. It also may be the first time spent away from a beloved family pet. The feelings of homesickness can easily be compounded when you’re also missing a lifelong animal companion.</p>
          <p>Pets that are low maintenance are best for college students and those include fish, hamsters and guinea pigs. Some students even have cats and dogs as pets but they require more attention than other animals.</p>
          <p>Some people aren't allowed to keep pets at their dorm, so they volunteer.</p>      
          <p>Having an animal enhances the whole idea of higher education producing well-rounded residents. All institutions say that all pets be of a non-aggressive type, that pets be made sterile or neutered, properly immunized, and treated for fleas.</p>

        <p>Most of students don’t have time to eat at home because of their busy schedules.</p> 
        <p>A significant number of college students have very low levels of food security, which can make classwork more difficult.</p>
        <p>In order to stay focused and absorb in what you learn in the classroom give yourself the fuel you need. One of the most important foods you should eat are milk and yogurt, oats, blueberries, salmon, walnuts.</p> 
        <p>Some quick and easy recipes: <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/245764/buffalo-chicken-mac-and-cheese/?internalSource=staff%20pick&referringId=1947&referringContentType=recipe%20hub"> Mac and Cheese</a>,<a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/19304/chicken-milano/?internalSource=hub%20recipe&referringId=1947&referringContentType=recipe%20hub">Chicken Milano</a>,<a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/16954/chinese-chicken-fried-rice-ii/?internalSource=hub%20recipe&referringId=1947&referringContentType=recipe%20hub">Chinese Chicken Fried Rice</a></p>
