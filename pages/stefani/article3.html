            <p class="contenttext">Here is the story of a foreign student, who successfully finished his education and is currently employed in Denmark. Read about how he managed to be a student in a foreign country.</p>
            <p class="question">Hey, Aivis. Thank you very much for agreeing to share your experience as a student in a foreign country. I can’t wait to hear your story! </p>
            <p class="answer"> Hey! The pleasure is mine. </p>
            <p class=" question"> Tell me something about yourself, Aivis. </p>
            <p class=" answer"> Well, my name is Aivis Grisevs, I am almost 26 and I am coming from a small city in Latvia. I came to Denmark 7 years ago. I finished AP-Degree in Multimedia Design and Communication and right now I am working in the industry for a Swedish company here in Aarhus. In my free time I like to play around with 3D and learn something more, and I am also a member of Fitness DK to keep myself fit. </p>
            <p class=" question"> So, why did you choose Denmark as the country to get your education in? </p>
            <p class=" answer">I had the option to go to study abroad and I knew I could get a free education in Denmark, so that was my biggest motivation to go out of Latvia, explore Europe and learn something about other cultures. </p>
            <p class=" question"> Have you previously been here, before you actually started your studies? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> Yes. I first came to Denmark at the age of 16. There was that European contest with topic “Alter ego”, which I won in Latvia. There was one winner in each country, and all of us spent one week in Denmark, attending different art-oriented events and seminars. It was really good experience, which help me made my choice about coming back here. </p>
            <p class=" question"> That sounds great, but how did you find out you can get e free education? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> I actually googled it. I found out about the possibility to come to Denmark online.</p>
            <p class=" question"> Did you applied by yourself or you had someone helping you with that? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> I contacted an agency in my home country, which helped me by taking care of all the documentation. </p>
            <p class=" question"> Can you tell me something more about where and when did you finished your degree? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> I finished MDC 5 years ago in the Business Academy in Aarhus. </p>
            <p class=" question"> What was it about BAAA that grabbed your attention? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> First of all, I chose it because it was in Aarhus, that was the city I wanted to come to. As second, and that is probably everyone else’s motivation, it is not just pure lecturing. I liked that there was a lot of project and group work, and I had the chance to connect with companies even while studying. </p>
            <p class=" question"> Why did you, Aivis, go for Multimedia Design and Communication? Was it a random decision or you had any experience in the area? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> I got interested in video production and photography when I was at the age of 15-16, so I had some experience in that area. Multimedia was my first choice when I was applying. As second, I had Web development and Marketing as third. But fortunately, I got accepted with my first choice. </p>
            <p class=" question"> Which subject did you like and dislike most, and why was that? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> Design was my favorite subject, as you probably have guessed already, because was interested in video production and video editing, and software like After Effects. I also really enjoyed Communication a lot. What I disliked most was probably programming, even though I understood it, but I straight away knew that this is not my thing. </p>
            <p class=" question"> MDC is a two-year AP-Degree and it combines 4 subjects. What were you spending most of your free time on when it comes to self-studying? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> Most of what I know I learned while I have been in a project. Nowadays you can find any kind of information online, so whatever I had struggle with, Youtube was there to give me an answer to my question. </p>
            <p class=" question"> Did you have time to work, if you were a full-time student? Were you able to get SU? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> Oh, yes, of course. I was working in a restaurant for a year and in Dansk Supermarked as well for a while. And no, I was not getting SU. At that time there was no such an option. </p>
            <p class=" question"> What do you think is the best student job and why? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> Well, there is no such thing as best student job. It depends on what kind of person you are. If you are open to communication with many people a restaurant or a café will be good for you, otherwise Dansk Supermarked or a cleaning job would fit you better. </p>
            <p class=" question"> Do you speak Danish, Aivis? Did you have time for Danish lessons while being a full-time student? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> Ja, det gør jeg. Hahaha. I started studying Danish when I was having my internship in the fourth semester. </p>
            <p class=" question"> Now when you mentioned internship, did you have your internship here or abroad? What did you do? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> I had my internship in Denmark in a company called Arriva. I was traveling and filming with the ambition to increase the local tourism, promoting different cities on the screens in the trains. </p>
            <p class=" question"> Did you find it easy or rather hard to combine school, work and Danish classes? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> Yes, it was hard. Sometimes I needed to sacrifice Danish classes in order to keep up with school or work.  </p>
            <p class=" question"> Student years are the best years, they say. Did you had a normal social life, meaning did you have the time for that? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> Haha. Yes, yes, I had some good parties throughout the way. </p>
            <p class=" question"> OK, Aivis, did you go for Top-up after finishing you AP-Degree? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> No, I didn’t. After my education I focused on building my portfolio and getting into the industry. </p>
            <p class=" question"> You said you are working right now. Can you tell me what is it that you do and for how long you have been working that? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> Year and a half after I finished I found a job in a Swedish company and I have been there for 3 years now. Mainly I am making video commercials for instore solutions for companies like 7/11, Telenor, Matas and others. </p>
            <p class=" question"> Are you used to speak only in Danish all day long at work? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> I must say it was quite a struggle to get used to that. I cannot say I am fluent to the level I would like myself to be, but I am working on it. </p>
            <p class=" question"> Can you then give an advice to the new coming students when it comes to studying Danish? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> Best solution is to find a Danish friend. This is what mostly helped me. Just attending classes and going to exams is not going to help a lot. </p>
            <p class=" question "> After living in Denmark for 7 years, you probably are familiar with Danish traditions or habits. Do you follow or practice any in you daily life? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> Well, I am familiar with plenty of them, but I cannot say I follow them. I really like typical Danish food though. </p>
            <p class=" question "> If you could change one thing connected to your student years, what would it be? </p>
            <p class=" answer"> It would have been better if I had SU and I didn’t to work as much, so I could focus more on studying. This a great advantage that students have now. </p>
            <p class=" question"> Give a final advice to future students coming to study and build a new life in Denmark. </p>
            <p class=" answer"> Don’t stress. Just do it. </p>
            <p class=" question" id="lastparagraph"> Thank you very much for your time, it was a pleasure listening to you.</p>
