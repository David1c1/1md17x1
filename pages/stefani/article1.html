            <h4 class="undertitle">By Stefani Yotova, October 07, 2017</h4>
            <img class="image" src="images/bookslandscape.jpg" alt="books landscape nature article one">
            <p class="contenttext">Student years are the best years, they said. And whoever they were, they totally had the right to say that. But why don‚Äôt you makeyour student years even more exciting? Why not challenge yourself and go study in Denmark?</p>
            <p class="contenttext">You say that‚Äôs crazy! Of course, it‚Äôs crazy, this is how all the good stories start like! But as a newcomer you are about to get few simple tips about how to make your fresh start in Denmark one idea easier.</p>
            <h2 class="paragraphtitle">"Why Denmark?"</h2>
            <p class="contenttext">1. You get your degree for free. Yes, exactly, her highness Queen Margrethe pays for your education, if you are a citizen of an European country or Switzerland.</p>
            <p class="contenttext">2. You are literally paid to study. Ok, now I have your attention. The rule is you work 11 hours per week in order to get student grant, which possibly covers the basic needs of yours per month. And if this is not convincing enough, after finishing school you also get the chance of financial support for the period of 2 years, in which you have the time to find your dream job.</p>
            <p class="contenttext">3. As last, but not least, Denmark is the happiest, and most <a class="hygge" href="http://www.visitdenmark.com/hygge-denmark-coziness">hyggeligt</a>, country in the world, regarding the results of the study about worlds happiness level in April, 2016.</p>
            <video class="mediavideo" src="images/denmarkhappy.mp4" controls></video>
            <h2 class="paragraphtitle">Some simple, but important tips for the very beginning</h2>
            <p class="contenttext">Make sure your English skills are on a pretty good level. Going there with ‚ÄúHi‚Äù, ‚ÄúYes‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is not the best idea, believe me. The language to start study from the zero is Danish, not English.</p>
            <p class="contenttext">And as I mentioned Danish, you would probably want to know about your possibilities as a student. International students in Denmark have access to free Danish language classes in 3 whole years! You probably started packing already, but wait I will get there as well.</p>
            <p class="contenttext">Of course, if you are going to study here, you would probably like to have a place to live. Please, apply for accommodation long enough period before you actually get here. This is a struggle almost everyone has to deal with. </p>
            <p class="contenttext">What to put in the suitcase? Remember you are going to Denmark, which means you can set the tank-tops and swimsuits aside; you aren‚Äôt going to need those here. Better pack some sweaters, few scarfs and warm socks. And gloves, DO NOT forget gloves, especially if you use your phone outside of home as much, as I do.</p>
            <img class="media" src="images/warmclothessuitcase.jpg"  alt="suitcase winter clothes warm clothes hat gloves">
            <p class="contenttext">Get a bike. When it comes to transport in Denmark, you could count more bicycles on the road rather than cars. It‚Äôs faster, easier and CHEAPER. </p>
            <p class="contenttext">Aaaaand the so long awaited first day at school finally comes. Being shy is not going to help you. Talk to as many people as you can. Don‚Äôt aim for just internationals. Try making friends with Danes, as well. Even though you might find that a bit challenging, because they are not as open as you are, for example. You need to earn their friendship. </p>
            <p class="contenttext">P.S: Comparing Denmark with your home country is not going to make it easier for you to get yourself together. Think about it the same way as what you read in the first sentence of this article, these are your best years. Get rid of the negative mindset and start dreaming, because in Denmark dreams come true. üòä</p>
            <p id="lastparagraph" class="contenttext">P.S 2: Probably you would want a good book to read during your flight. Give a go to "<a class="hygge" href="http://www.powells.com/post/original-essays/happy-as-a-dane-planting-seeds-of-happiness-the-danish-way">Happy as a Dane</a>" by Malene Rydahl, and learn the 10 secrets of the happiest people in the world.</p>
