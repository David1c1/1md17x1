        <h2 class="articletitle">Long story short, I got a crush</h2>
        <h4 class="undertitle">By Stefani Yotova, October 06, 2017</h4>
        <img class="mediaas" src="images/stefani.jpg"  alt="books landscape nature article one">
         <p class="contenttext">Let me guess, you are just after high school and you are about to come to study in Denmark. Oh, sweet moments of excitement and butterflies in the stomach, but stress and cold sweat at the same time. I remember that as it was yesterday. You want to read my story? Grab a cup of coffee, it might take a while…</p>
         <p class="contenttext">Let me start by saying that in 2014 I was a nerdy senior in high school, studying intensively German in order to continue my education in Germany. Can you imagine five years of German, we all know German and all the memes about it. It will get clearer later.</p>
        <h2 class="paragraphtitle">26.11.2014 <br> I was going to Denmark</h2>
        <p class="contenttext">My parents decided to tell me about what my Christmas present this year is going to be. “You are going to Denmark”, they said, “you will visit your cousin for the Christmas holiday”. </p>
        <h2 class="paragraphtitle">17.12.2014 <br> Visit Denmark for the first time</h2>
         <p class="contenttext">Three weeks later, I got on the plane, and 14 hours later I finally arrived at the place, where my cousin was living. At that point she was sharing an apartment with another Bulgarian chica and two Latvian guys, who are brothers. So far so good. </p>
         <p class="contenttext">I cannot say it was very productive holiday when it comes to sightseeing, since the girls were busy with school and internship. Whatsoever, the older one of the guys had taken some days off work. (At this very point I must confess that I was not really fluent in English.) He, obviously, really liked tea, and, obviously, really wanted to drink tea with me. And this is how it all started.</p>
        <h2 class="paragraphtitle">06.01.2015 <br> Welcome back home</h2>
         <p class="contenttext">My parents were really surprised to hear that I have changed my mind about going to Germany. The first time they suggested that I should rather go to Denmark, I reacted pretty harsh. Having in mind that I had completely pledged myself to German for one/fourth of my entire life, it’s understandable why. </p>
         <p class="contenttext">Anyways, it was three weeks before the deadline for applying to university. I spend them home studying English, in order to be able to get good results on my English exam. That was the last thing I needed to do, before the agency in my home country connected me to Danish schools.</p>
        <h2 class="paragraphtitle">06.2015 <br> I was enrolled in the program <br>Value Chain Management </h2>
         <p class="contenttext">The so long-awaited letter was in my hands, I was accepted and I needed to start packing. Comfy pajamas from grandma, quite a few sweaters and a pair of gloves were on top of my list.</p>
        <h2 class="paragraphtitle">05.07.2015 <br> First chapter of my new life <br> Welcome to Denmark</h2>
         <p class="contenttext">I must say not everything happened as I had expected it to. My relationship with my cousin fell apart the moment my parents left for Bulgaria. That was the moment I realized I was already on my own.</p>
         <p class="contenttext">The first 6 months of my residence in Denmark I spent with no CPR, no address, no job or SU. Well, not an actual job, but I had some income, coming from cleaning private houses and babysitting, which was barely covering my rent and food expenses.</p>
         <p class="contenttext">School also got me unprepared, because everything was so much different from what I had experienced in Bulgaria. There were surely good and bad things, but what mostly surprised me was the atmosphere in class. There was no formality and we only called the teachers by their first name. </p>
         <p class="contenttext">I am not going to lie, it was pretty tough period of my life, considering that the only person I could lean on didn’t like me as much anymore. I was alone, I was broke, and I really missed mom and dad. It was time for me to go back home for Christmas.</p>
        <h2 class="paragraphtitle">03.01.2016 <br> New apartment, new me</h2>
         <p class="contenttext">Just in the beginning of the new year I moved to a new apartment with the Latvian brothers I had met a year ago, the strangers that had become my family, closest friends and strength in my new life.</p>
         <p class="contenttext">It took me a semester to realize that the education I had chosen wasn’t for me. In one semester I had had few different teachers, teaching me a subject completely different from what they had specialized in. </p>
         <p class="contenttext">Whatsoever, I was not the only that dropped that education. When VIA in Vejle stopped VCM from running, those 25 people joined the 2 classes in Aarhus, approximately 90 students in overall. Right now 16 people are having an internship in VCM. You do the math. </p>
        <h2 class="paragraphtitle">01.02.2016 <br> Found a job </h2>
         <p class="contenttext">After 7 months I finally got a job. I was employed by a cleaning company in Aarhus, and my job was to clean a school every day, 5 hours per day. I can’t say that was the best experience, because the hourly rate was pretty low, but that was where my income was coming from for an entire year.</p>
         <p class="contenttext">Since I was not studying anymore and I was not really satisfied with my job and my life in overall, I started attending Danish language lessons 3 days a week.</p>
        <h2 class="paragraphtitle">12.2016 <br> It was time to start thinking<br> about my future </h2>
         <p class="contenttext">I was on the page of Business Academy Aarhus and I accidently saw that there were 10 free places for Multimedia Design and Communication for the winter semester. I decided to give it a go. I went there few times, talked to different people and applied, this time by myself. Unfortunately, I didn’t get accepted, but I decided that I am not going to stop here.</p>
        <h2 class="paragraphtitle">28.08.2017 <br> I started school again</h2>
         <p class="contenttext">As I said, I didn’t stop after the first time I applied for Multimedia. Now I was accepted and I was ready to give all from myself to make it work. </p>
         <p id="lastparagraph" class="contenttext">The moral of the story is that even if it’s hard and you want to give it all up, everything is against you and you think you cannot keep up anymore, just keep on trying, be strong and it will all pay off at the end. It worked out for me, it will work for you too!</p>
