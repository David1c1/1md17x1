  <h4>  1) Getting Your Chair Right.</h4>
Every time you work, take time to adjust workstations that aren't feeling quite right while using them. This will help you minimize awkward and frequently performed movements.

	 <h4>2) Reduce prolonged computer usage time whenever possible.</h4>

	<h4>3) Make sure your computer monitor is at eye level.</h4>

Ensure the viewing screen is directly in front, approximately arms-length away, with the top of the screen positioned slightly below eyelevel.
