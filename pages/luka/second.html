        <p>You are now a grown up! Finally you realized that sitting on couch and eating chips for a whole day is not the best idea so you turned on your <strong>brain</strong> and used opportunity to live and study in Denmark! You have packed your stuff and came in Denmark not even knowing that there is one thing that is going to make you suffer, called <b>PAPERWORK!</b></p>
        <p>If you come from underdeveloped country like I do, than make sure to get every single paper that we will put in the list so you don’t have to call your parents at 2 o’clock at night to send them to you. Like some of us did(actually me)… Don’t panic people, I just love to joke around!</p>
        <p>In this article, I will cover everything you are supposed to know and <strong>if I missed out something feel free to fix me</strong> so we can make this magazine as useful as possible for future generations of students!</p>
        <p><b>When you get to the bottom of the list, you will see a text explaining you where should you go to apply for <a title="Explained" href="http://www.statsforvaltningen.dk/site.aspx?p=6394">Eu residency papers</a> / <a title="Cpr explained" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/Coming-to-Denmark/CPR-Bank-NemID/CPR---Registration-in-Denmark">Cpr number!</a></b></p>
        <h2>Requirements for Eu residency paper / Cpr number:</h2>
        <ul class="listing">

            <li>2 copy of your passport</li>

        <h3 class="tips">Tips:</h3>
        <ul class="listing">
            <li>Before arriving to Denmark check your papers!</li>
            <li>Make sure to make all copies in your hometown. Reason for it is because you really won’t have enough time to do it here in Denmark but also you will pay 40dkk(5euro) for 3 pages(<b>until you get your student card</b>)!</li>
            <li>Making a passport size photo is 100dkk(17euro) so consider making at least 5 od them at home. Trust me you <strong>will need them!</strong></li>
            <li>You can also fill out these papers at home because you will maybe get confused by some questions. <strong>Feel free to reach us</strong> if you need any help!</li>
            <li>Be sure to check if your university have send the acceptance letter! For example, I only had a letter which said that I am conditionally accepted so I wasn’t able to apply for anything!</li>
            <li><b>Maybe you have opportunity to finish everything in university!</b> Some universities organize event where you can finish your paperwork! That’s why I am stressing out to <strong>make sure</strong> that you have all the papers so they don’t decline you( Like they declined me)</li>
        </ul>

            <h3 class="h32">IMPORTANT!</h3>
            <p><strong>If you haven’t found accommodation in Aarhus before you arrive here, and you are staying in <a class="crvenilink" href="https://www.studenterhusaarhus.dk/projects/startup-housing">"Startup housing"</a> you need to make copy of your accommodation paper for next 3 weeks. Reason for copies is so they can make sure that you will actually stay in Denmark for next 3 weeks but also <strong>you will receive your papers on that address!</strong> If it comes to situation where you need to change your address, <b>you need to go to the <a class="crvenilink" href="https://dokk1.dk/english">Dokk1</a></b> or you will receive a fine from goverment</strong>
