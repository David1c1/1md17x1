        <p>Thanks God, you are now finished with paperwork! I hope that you are still alive! Now you need to find a place to stay if you don’t want to sleep under the bridge(fun fact: Bridge in Godsbanen changes colors, so you will have a nice time there). Let’s get serious now!</p>
        <p>I will be honest with you, it’s hard but not impossible! If you have tried to find accommodation in Aarhus so far, you know what I am talking about! Pages are so badly organized and for most of them you will have to pay a lot!</p>
        <p>Here I will give you some tips on where to look for and what to pay attention on!</p>
        <h2>Startup housing!</h2>
        <p>First of all, apply for <a href="https://www.studenterhusaarhus.dk/projects/startup-housing">“Startup housing Aarhus</a>. This is the best and the easiest way to find place to stay in Aarhus. I will list some of pros and cons bellow!</p>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li>Cheapest option</li>
            <li>Easy to search around website</li>
            <li>Well organized </li>
            <li>All of rooms/apartments are in dorms</li>
            <li>100% legal (you don’t need to think who is going to be your landlord or will he kick you out or can you register your address and so on)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li>It is hard to get accommodation</li>
            <li>You need to apply at least 3 moths before arrival</li>
            <li>Make sure that you have done the “student guarantee” thing to be sure that you will get something before you come to Aarhus because otherwise no one knows are you going to get anything on time!</li>
            <li>Student guarantee (It is very good option but you never know what dorm are you going to get because as guarantee they will give you the random dorm with empty space!</li>
        </ul>
        <section class="facebook">
            <h2>Facebook!</h2>
            <p>Facebook is the biggest platform on internet for searching for accommodation! There you can find so many people looking for a roommate or offering a flat. You have bigger chances of finding a place here than on any other website. If you want I will make a article about them and also link them for you. But <b>be careful</b> here if you don’t want to be scammed! <strong>Make sure to read my pros, cons but also tips for facebook groups!</strong>
            </p>
            <h3>Pros:</h3>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>Easy to search</li>

                <li>Good deals</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Cons:</h3>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>You can’t be sure if the place is legal</li>
                <li>You can end up with paying a lot for deposit</li>
                <li>Sometimes contracts are made to scam you</li>
                <li>There were cases where landlords didn’t give the deposit back, so be careful how much are you playing for it!</li>
            </ul>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li>Don’t pay too much for deposit because you can loss it!</li>
                <li>Most of the apartments and dorms in Aarhus are unfurnished so make sure to ask before you pay for it. So you can know if you need to buy your own!</li>
                <li>When applying for dorm on Student housing, choose dorms on the same side of city as your university inorder to save time!</li>
                <li><strong>NEVER</strong>, but <strong>NEVER</strong> pay agency to search for accommodation for you! You will waste your money or they will find something super expensive!</li>
