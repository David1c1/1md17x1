            <h1>Leave your parents money alone</h1>
            <p>Now you are ready to stand on your legs! The hardest part is behind you so now you are able to focus on your studies and also to find a proper job. Finding a job in Denmark is essential because you can’t get your SU without it! </p>
            <h2>Tips:</h2>
            <ul class="iwanttosleep">
                <li>Write the <b>CV</b> (<b>it’s important to have one because no one will hire you before you send them your CV</b>)</li>
                <li>Make networks (After arriving in Denmark you are going to face the fact that almost everyone is looking for same thing as you, so it will be a little bit hard. So don’t waste your time only on research, instead hangout with other people, create friendships, ask them if they know anyone who is looking for a worker…)</li>
                <li>Be direct (Most of the people in Denmark like to be <strong>direct when it comes to the job search</strong>. From my friends experiences before they directly to the company, no one wanted to answer their e-mails. So grab few copies of your CV give it to employees of the companies. You will be surprised how people positively react to that. Than they know that you are <b>open minded</b>, <b>brave</b> and <b>communicative!</b></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Types of jobs and requirements:</h2>
            <p>When looking for a job make sure that you mentioned where you have <b>worked</b> so far. That gives you opportunity to get the job easier but also to get a higher salary and even to get a job in your profession! But even if you are looking for a simple job such as dish washer, delivery guy/girl, babysitter, mention your history of jobs anyways! People will <b>appreciate</b> that!</p>
            <h2>Working hours and salary:</h2>
            <p>Working hours in Denmark are fixed. You need to <b>work 40 hours a month</b> in order to get yourself a <b>SU</b>. If you are not looking for a SU this doesn’t apply for you! But stick to the rules in order to make your studies here much easier. It is enough for a student to work on weekends if he/she wants to study in same time. And combination of 40 hours and SU will allow you to live a normal life!!!</p>
            <h2>Mistakes:</h2>
            <p>When you get a job make sure that you know how high you salary is, so none can scam you! Don’t let someone force you to work overtime hours without getting paid! It is better to look for something else!</p>
