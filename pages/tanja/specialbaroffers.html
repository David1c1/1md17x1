                    <h3>Hammering nails</h3>
                    <p><b>(Heidi's Bier Bar, Hos Anton, Die Kleine Bierstube, Kuhstall)</b></p>
                    <p>Several bars in Aarhus offer the chance of showing off your skills at hammering nails into a wooden log.</p>
                    <p>It might sound strange, but it's fun, you'll get rid of some aggressions, and it's a brilliant chance to show off at the bars!</p>
                    <p>Usually the bars take a small fee around <b>10-20 kr.</b> for a couple of nails, but you might have a shot at winning some free alcohol, if you can hammer in the nail in one try!</p>

                    <h3>Rent a ping pong bat and get a free beer</h3>
                     <p><b>(Shen Mao)</b></p>
                     <p>Well.. The beer is not literally free, since you have to rent a ping pong bat for <b>25 kr.</b> in order to get your free beer.</p>
                    <p>But since you can play ping pong for an unlimited time with your bat (until the bar closes of course), it is totally worth the price! And don't worry about it being crowded, cause people here like to play "around the table", so there is room for everyone to join!</p>
                     <p>You receive your free beer upon returning the bat, so you'll have a beer "to walk on" on your way to the next special offer in town!</p>

                    <h3>Go powerbowling and win free shots!</h3>
                    <p><b>(Bowl n' fun, Aarhus Bowlinghal)</b></p>
                    <p>On thursdays, fridays and saturdays you can enjoy bowling with your friends in festive sorroundings with loud music and disco lights.</p>
                    <p>If you are lucky enough to get a red bowling cone in your bowling lane, you have a chance at winning free shots for you and your friends!</p>
                    <p>All you have to do is make a strike with the red bowling pin in front.. Remember to notify the bartender beforehand though, and perhabs you should leave this one up to the best player on your team..</p>
