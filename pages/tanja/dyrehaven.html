                     If you don't have a fear for deer, you should definitely take a walk in "Dyrehaven" and experience the deer on extremely close hold! Or you could bring a picnic and enjoy it on one of the many table-benches around the park!

                    <h3>Remember the carrots and apples</h3>
                    <p>Experiencing nature should be free, and so is the deerpark! But buying some carrots or apples to feed the deer with will definitely be worth the money!</p>
                    <p>You should only do this if you're not afraid of getting really close to them, since they'll be all around you as soon as they see what you brought!</p>
                    <p>Remember not to feed the deer pasta or bread, since it's bad for them.</p>

                    <h3>Pay attention to the rules</h3>
                    <p>Since the park is the home of the deer, you should always follow the rules of the park and be respectful.</p>
                    <p>You're not allowed to bring your dog, ride a bike, run og jog, throw trash or collect the chestnuts and acorns from the ground, since it's what the deer feed on, when people aren't bringing them food.</p>
                    <p>You are however allowed to touch the animals, and you're even allowed to ski and ride sleds in the park during winter.</p>
