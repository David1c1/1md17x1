                <article>
                    <p class="intro">I bet you listen to music on a daily basis, why not take it to a whole new level? <br>This short article will give you just the insight you need to impress your friends when they ask you: “Whatcha listenin’ to?”
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>It might be clever to start with the very fundamental definition of what it is that you actually hear. Sound is composed of mechanical waves that you perceive thanks to your ears which, when you actually look up something about them, will make you go just: „Wow, how is that even possible?“. You create these waves without maybe even realizing it by, for example, typing the positive review for this magazine which you are surely doing right now.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Musical instruments were invented exactly for this purpose, to create specific sounds waves. (How smart was that! The world is an awesome place…) All these examples are what we call „acoustic sounds“.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>But one day something like this happened: „Hey Billy, play louder, I cannot hear your beats!“ „Dude, my fingers are falling apart, I cannot play any louder than that!“ „Wait, I have an idea! Let’s put some electricity into the guitar, that’s bound to help, yo!“ – this is how the modern music era began. (And how Billy ended…)</p>
                    
                    <p>People realized that electricity is, just like sound, waves! Boom, analogue sound - sound waves turned into voltage that can be reproduced back to sound waves at a force that Billy couldn’t have even dreamt about!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>OK, let’s jump to the more recent times. Behold the creation of digital audio! We have here an exclusive transcript of how it all went down: „Hi Eleanor, I am just calling to let you know how much I despise carrying my music tapes with me! I just wish there was a way to have all my jams with me that wouldn’t require a 100l backpack…” “Oh my gawd Catelyn, I know right, magnetic tapes are surely not the future! I have been thinking, you cannot put voltage in your pocket…but what if you carried just some information about the voltage that could later be transformed back into the voltage!” “Eleanor, you are so genius, do you know that? But, how are we going to pull this off?” “My boiifriend Bill has something in his garage, he says it’s capable of remembering things by tearing them apart to 0’s and 1’s, whatever that means, we could try that, doesn’t matter if we break it, it’s not like he’s ever going to make money from that…”
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Digital audio enables you to store all the recordings as a (big) bunch 0’s and 1’s, with the weight and physical size being just the weight and physical size of your playback device! No, it’s not black magic, as you will see for yourself right now.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>In order for your audio to become digital, it needs to be transformed into binary digits. This is done by so called sampling, a process where a device designed for this purpose (e.g. audio interface) cuts the voltage waves into pieces and converts them to binary values. We are talking about veery big frequencies, the standard for a CD is 44,1KHz, which means that the wave is cut 44 100 times every second. These samples are then turned into zeros and ones - bits. The number of bits per sample is called bit depth and the standard for a CD is 16bit, which means that every sample consists of 16 zeros or ones which correspond to the original wave’s state.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>And there we go, we have almost all of the audio file properties explained! Except for one, maybe the most misinterpreted one, the bitrate. An audio file’s bitrate is quite often linked to its quality, but in fact it’s nothing more than the amount of information that that the file delivers every second. And even though more data usually means more fidelity/quality/whatever, it’s not necessarily true. We will look into this matter in the next article so that you are a genuine audio master when you’re finished reading.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>You now have all the knowledge to calculate an uncompressed audio file’s bitrate! Let’s try it with a CD. As we’ve learned before, CD uses the sampling frequency of 44,1KHz and the bit depth of 16bit. This is where math comes in. 44 100(number of samples in each second)*16(number of bits in each sample)*2(number of audio channels – stereo) = 1 411 200bit. Now, that does not tell us anything because hardly anyone out there these days measures data size in bits. When divided by 1 000, we get the size in kilobits. Audio on a Compact Disc has the bitrate of 1 411,2 kbps (kilobits per second) - the amount of data in one second.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>You might now be saying: "Wait a minute! My Mp3 has the same sampling frequency and bit depth as a CD, whyy is the bitrate so much smaller?!" Well that's because your Mp3 is a compressed audio file! In the next article we will look into this matter, also answering this question.
