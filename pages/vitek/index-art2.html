                        <p>„Eyo Steve, what was the song that you were playing the other day?“ „Oh boi, a banger, isn’t it, I can give you a Mp3, so that you can play it on your phone!“ „You the best Steve!!!“
                        </p>

                    <p>Do you recognize yourself there? Mp3 has no doubt become something like a synonym for downloaded music. Question of the day: Is it really that good? I say, for too long has this format ruled the music file kingdom! Join me for a quick ride through the audio format land and WITNESS!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>It might be quite demanding to orientate yourself on the, today quite richly filled, audio format market. With all the .something flying around, let me explain at least the basics of distinguishing between various formats. And let’s skip the categorizing that everyone forgets in thirty seconds and start with a reeally well-known example instead.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Mpeg-1 Layer III, a.k.a. Mp3, is a lossy compression audio format. It is therefore not the original audio stream, but a compressed version of the original. In the compression process it discards some pieces of the original data, thus lossy.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>What is a lossy compression and why would you do it in the first place? As the name hints, compression means lowering the size, but in the case of lossy compression it comes at the price of data fidelity. A real-life example would be fitting an A3 paper in your bag. If it’s physically bigger than the bag, you either have to fold it or make a ball or whatever, the point is, you can never bring it back to the original state and the paper is no longer as pretty as it used to be. Same for lossy audio file compression, once you go lossy you can’t go back.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Mp3’s original intention was to store audio from Compact Discs. In today’s crazy world where you can buy MicroSD cards with 256GB capacity, the original, uncompressed size can be considered ridiculous. But Mp3 is actually 24 years old! And let’s face it, today’s electronic devices’ level is nowhere near comparable to the one 24 years ago…
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Opus audio is, just like Mp3, a lossy compression format. The main difference is that it was initially released in 2012, making it a much more up-to-date technology. The company that stands behind the creation of Opus did a reeally great job. Just like Mp3, it compresses the original file making the bitrate and the file size much smaller. As opposed to Mp3, however, it does not “scar” the original that much and the quality is supposedly even twice as high when compared to the Mp3 equivalent. Google recognized this power and has made Opus the YouTube standard audio format. So, these days on YouTube every upload’s audio gets converted to Opus by Google. If the artist/a wise user uploads the music in its either totally uncompressed, or lossless-compressed version, majority of the quality remains preserved and Google saves a lot of space on their servers, everybody is happy, yaay!

                    <p>A significant percentage of people in my survey answered they use Flac as the audio format. Flac stands for “free lossless audio codec”, so we are now dealing with lossless compression. Now, lossless compression actually is a bit of black magic. Make the file smaller AND do not lose any fidelity?! It works on the principle of packing repetitive things together and then unpacking them again…It’s like making a roll out of the A3 paper that you can then non-destructively unroll afterwards. Only, both with the paper and the file, the size will not be as small as it would be if you made a ball/lossy compressed file instead.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Now that sounds cool, doesn’t it? “Why not put everything from my Mp3s to Flac, I got like five 256gig Micro SDs, I can afford my beats to take up a bit more space!!” Well if you recall the wise words from earlier, once you go lossy, you cannot go back! I once saw an accurate comparison to this. Imagine your music as water in a glass. If you pour all the water from a smaller glass, Mp3, to a big glass, Flac, you still have the same amount of water and only get a bigger glass to carry. So, if you convert an Mp3 to Flac, you only get bigger file size, no additional fidelity…equals…no point in doing that. If you want the lossless magic to work, you have to create it from an uncompressed audio file.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>If you gained even the slightest amount of knowledge by reading my articles, then I succeeded hardcore. You can now listen to your music with the pleasant feeling that you actually know what is up. Thank you, music is love, music is life! ♥
