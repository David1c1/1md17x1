							<h3 class="sub-title">Kings Cup</h3>

							<p>Kings (king's cup, donut, jug oval, of fire, or ring of fire) is a drinking game that uses playing cards. The player must drink and dispense drinks based on cards drawn. Each card has a rule that is predetermined before the game starts. This game is a lot of fun and will get you hammered super quickly. You can make your own rules but here is a guideline:</p>
							<p>Ace: Waterfall - To perform a waterfall, each player starts drinking their beverage at the same time as the person to their left. No player can stop drinking until the player before them stops.</p>
							<p>2: Give 2 and possibly a third - You point at two persons and tell them to drink. You can also tell one person to take two drinks.</p>
							<p>3: Take 3 - "Three is me." You take a drink</p>
							<p>4: Give 2 Take 2 - You give out two drinks, and take two yourself.</p>
							<p>5: Rule - Set a rule to be followed, e.g. drink with your left hand, tap your head before you drink, don't use first names, etc.</p>
							<p>6: Thumbs - Place your thumb on the table, and try to do this without anyone noticing. As people notice, they will also have to put their thumb on the table too. The last person to place their thumb on the table drinks.</p>
							<p>7: Raise your hand to heaven - Last person to raise their hand will drink.</p>
							<p>8: Mate - Choose a person to be your mate and they drink when you drink for the rest of the game.</p>
							<p>9: Rhyme Time "Nine is Rhyme" - You say a word, and the person to your right has to say a word that rhymes. This continues around the table until someone cannot think of a word. This person must drink. The same word may not be used twice.</p>
							<p>10: Categories - You come up with a category of things, and the person to your right must come up with something that falls within that category. This goes on around the table until someone can't come up with anything. This person must drink.</p>
							<p>Jack: Guys Drink - All the guys at the table must take a drink</p>
							<p>Queen: Gals Drink - All the gals at the table must take a drink</p>
							<p>King: King's Cup - When each of the first 3 Kings are drawn, the person who drew the card puts some of their drink into the King's Cup at the center of the table. When the 4th King is drawn, the person who drew the 4th King must drink the contents of the King's Cup.</p>

							<h3 class="sub-title">Fuzzy Duck</h3>
							<p>Say "fuzzy duck" to the person on your left. The person next to you can either say "fuzzy duck" again, or "does he". If they say "does he", you must say "ducky fuzz", going right. "Does he" can change direction again. If you mess up, you take a drink.</p>

							<h3 class="sub-title">Let's Go Camping</h3>
							<p>Someone picks a place to go camping e.g. a basketball court, but keeps it secret. Players suggest things to bring and the winner is the person who correctly guesses where they're camping. So, "a tent" is wrong, as there are no tents in basketball courts. But "trainers" is right. If you get it wrong, drink. If you win, you choose the next destination.</p>
