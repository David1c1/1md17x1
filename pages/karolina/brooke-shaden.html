                        <p> She is an American artist, author and motivational speaker, born March 1987 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. After discovering her passion for photography, she quickly became a well-known fine art photographer and, at age 24, the youngest artist in The Annenberg Space for Photography's "Digital Darkroom" exhibition. She started creating her best known series of self portraits as at the beginning of career she was too intimidated to make contact with models. She wanted to have more control over final results and understand being on the other side of the camera. </p>

                        <p> Due to her personal story, her digital creations often refer to living with anxiety and overcoming own fears and boundaries. Newly posted artworks are provided with notes explaining ideology behind each photo and addressing issues of existential matter. Through the statement on her official Facebook profile, she says “this is a safe space to share your personal journey and to join me on mine. My wish is that you find your passion and pursue to live an inspired life.” </p>
