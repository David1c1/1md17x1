                    </header>
                    <p>We've all done it, we've all been there.</p>
                    <p>That moment when you watch the viral video on Youtube your friend just sent you and two hours later you find yourself exploring YouTubes suggested video section until you know all about how girrafs mate, how to make a rainbow cake and whether Prince Harry will actually propose to Meghan Markle, realizing you just spent 2 hours of your time doing "nothing".</p>&nbsp;
                    <p> Sometimes those hours of doing nothing should be embraced, other times there's just no room for such tempting procrastination.</p>
                    <p>At "the grid", we have had my fair share of trial and error when it comes to social media distraction and sometimes we're still trying to find my balance.</p>&nbsp;

                    <p>We have, however, implemented a few simple measures in order to manage our time on the Internet without getting distracted from what we came to do.</p>&nbsp;
                    <h3><b>Here is what we suggest: </b></h3>&nbsp;
                    <p><b>Read instead of watch:</b></p>&nbsp;
                    <p>We all love blogs and YouTube videos. However, since there is almost an indefinite amount of videos you can watch, it is very hard to find a balance. </p>
                    <p>Due to the vast information portrayed in a video in such a short time, watching videos makes us less productive then when read an article, as the information is easier to digest in our own pace.</p>
                    <p>In stressful times, where we need to ge things done, we recommend reading blogs instead of watching vlogs, it will make it easier to stop reading and get to work.</p>
                    <div class="picture">
                        <img src="image/3.jpg" alt="bun"></div>
                    <p><strong>Set a limit</strong></p>

                    <p>When you do feel like you want to reward yourself and indulge in some YouTube videos we recommend giving yourself a time frame in which you can do that. This way you will be the one in charge of what you do when and won't be led by temptation. </p>
                    <p>To view videos, try watching them over <a href="http://viewpure.com/">viewpure.com</a>, which is a site where you basically just type in a search term or the URL of the video you want to watch and it will show the video to you without any distractions like video suggestions or any other kind of advertisement.</p>&nbsp;

                    <p dir="ltr"><strong>Block the site if necessary.</strong></p>
                    <p>Since YouTube videos are most people's biggest Internet vice, we also recommend using the
                        <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/blocksite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block site </a>for your browser or the <a href="https://selfcontrolapp.com/">self-control app</a> for your computer, which is an app that prevents you from having access to "dangerous" sites during the times you need to be productive.</p>&nbsp;

                    <p><strong>It is ok to unfollow your friends on facebook!</strong> </p>

                    <p>The next option you have in order to become more productive is to unfollow those friends on facebook who you occasionally want to keep in touch with, but don't necessarily want to be spammed with everything they share on a daily basis.</p>
                    <p> They will never know that you unfollowed them and we think it's a nice way to avoid facebook spam.</p>
                    &nbsp;
                    <p><u>How to unfollow your friends:  </u></p>&nbsp;
                    <p>If you access FB through www.Facebook.com, click â–¼ on the top right blue bar, click News Feed Setting, click People on the left, you'll see who you're following or not, just click Following to unfollow.</p>&nbsp;
                    <p>If you access FB through m.FB or FB app, click Menu, scroll down, you'll see Manage News Feed, click it, then follow the same steps as above.</p>
                    &nbsp;
                    <p><b><strong>Little tip from "the grid" to you:</strong></b></p>&nbsp;

                    <p>Since we are all students and occasionally work late on our computers, many of us have had a few issues with falling asleep after a long session of being on the Internet.</p> &nbsp;

                    <p>Read in this <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/14/sleep-life-sleeplessness-blue-light-computers-early-death" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> about how blue light can affect your sleeping patterns, and how you can prevent a blue light screen with <a href="http://justgetflux.com/">justgetflux.com</a> , which lets you download a feature that "makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day".</p>&nbsp;

                    <p>It basically turns the light on your computer screen into a warm orange at night and will eliminate the problems of falling asleep after an "all -nighter".</p>

                        <h2 class="entry-title">Sustainable Solutions </h2>
                    </header>


                    <p>We want it all!</p>

                    <p>As students, want to get good grades at uni without having to compromise on our partying endeavours, we want to eat gourmet without breaking the bank and we want to be sustainable without the effort.</p>

                    <p>Well luckily the grid dug deep for you this week, to solve these solitions with one answer: <strong>sustainability</strong>.</p>
                    &nbsp;
                    <p>When in doubt of how to approach a new area of sustainability, we find it best to apply <a href="http://www.zerowastehome.com/2011/09/how-to-get-started/">Bea Johnsons 5 Rs in order</a>(leaving out the Rot), which make the process of change a little easier and organized.</p>&nbsp;

                    <p><strong>REFUSE </strong></p>

                    <p>You start university, you get showered with gift bags here and gift bags there, containing free plastic pencils, notebooks, flyers, candy, red bull a plastic juice bottle and usually some kind of key chain. All of these items usually come in a plastic bag.</p>

                    <p>In the beginning, you might be tempted to take them, thinking you could miss out on important information but very soon you'll fiund out that those bags are merely there for advertising certain brands and after careful inspection of everything in the bag, you'll decided that you won't need any of the items gifted to you.</p>&nbsp;
                    <div class="picture">
                        <img src="image/student.jpg" alt="bun"></div>

                    <p><strong>REDUCE</strong></p>

                    <p>How many notebooks could you possibly need? How many pens and sticky notes are necessary? Could you do without highlighters?</p>

                    <p>To save paper, we recommend taking notes on your computer whenever possible, which will save you time formating and organising your notes later on. For smaller tests, you can simply convert your notes into a pdf file and send it to your eReader for easy access. </p>
                    <p>For bigger exams, you can simply print out your conveniently organized notes on recycled paper and highlight with biodegradable highlighter pens.</p>
                    <p> When it comes to calenders, the phone is a convenient way of keeping track of chores and we especially appreciate the reminder during hectic uni periods.</p>
                    <p> For the occasional scribble and note taking, we love a good old fashioned Lamy fountain pen with an ink converter, stylish and eco-friendly #winwin.</p>&nbsp;

                    <p><strong>REUSE</strong></p>

                    <p>Everyone knows that the most expensive thing about going to Uni is the list of books we are expected to purchase every semester. Purchasing those books preloved will not only relieve your wallet but also the eco system.</p>
                    <p> For that, you can search your local library, join facebook second-hand book groups and find the rest on eBay.</p>

                    <p>If you are looking to purchase a new folder, we really like cardboard folders and if you need something more robust, we love recycled aluminum folders.</p>

                    <p>Another thing we never leave the house without is our reusable coffee cup, as you never know when fatigue hits and you need a quick energy boost before the next class starts.</p>&nbsp;

                        <img src="image/6.jpg" alt="bun"></div>
                    <p><strong>RECYCLE</strong></p>

                    <p>To fill our Lamy fountain pen, we would purchase the ink in a glass bottle, which is easily recyclable after it was emptied.</p>
                    <p> The other thing we suggest recycling and repurposing is the paper you used to print your notes on.</p>
                    <p>Applying these tips might not only make you a more sustainable student, they make you more organised and thus reserves for both studying and partying, it will save you money that you can spend on that gourmet food you've been craving that's it....problem solved.</p>
