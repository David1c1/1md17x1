                    <p>Here at "the Grid" we like to work hard, so our rewards can be even sweeter. When it comes to our perfect turning up drink for the weekend, we like to make sure that whatever we put in our bodies is as clean, healthy and delicious as possible in order for us to prevent study fatigue on Mondays, but we are not willing to compromise on taste.</p>&nbsp;
                    <p><u>Here is the recipe to our favorite anti-hangover cocktail:</u></p>
                    <div class="picture">
                        <img src="image/cock1.png" alt="bun"></div>

                    <p>Simply squeeze the grapefruit and mix the juice with the rest of the ingredients. Add the carbonated water at the end,voil√°!</p>
                    &nbsp;
                    <p><u><b>Health Benefits </b></u></p>&nbsp;
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li><b>Grapefruit</b> smooths skin, strengthens your immune system, boosts your metabolism and is said to reduce stress.</li>
                        <li><b>Peppermint </b>is often used as a fever reducer and it's containing rosmarinic acid has antioxidant abilities that are known to neutralize free radicals.</li>
                        <li><b>Honey </b>is a natural source of energy and boosts your memory, which basically makes it the perfect ingredient for date night.</li>
                    </ul>
                    &nbsp;
                    <p>This power combination mixed with a little bit of <a href="http://www.farmersgin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organic gin</a>, which is known to improve digestion, is just the perfect Valentine's Day Drink.</p>

                    &nbsp;
                    <p><u><b>Tip:</b></u></p>&nbsp;

                    <p>We trust for all of you to drink responsibly and to know your limits. Peer pressure is real and we advice to prepare a good answer to "Why aren't you drinking" in beforehand.</p>&nbsp;
                    <p> If you don't want to drink alcohol but still want to be part of the fun, you can also leave out the gin and make this a virgin cocktail. Tastes just as lovely!</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Yes, yes, yes our schedules are full, our social calenders even fuller but sometimes it is important to turn out attention inward and take care of our well being. By taking care of ourselves in a wholesome way, we apply preventative measures that keep our bodies and minds from going on strike when it is most inconvenient.</p>&nbsp;

                    <p>Here are our <strong>top 10 tips</strong> for wholesome indulgences that feed the mind, the body and the soul.</p>
                    &nbsp;
                    <p><strong>Go for a walk</strong> </p>
                    <p>and explore nature. Put on comfortable clothes in which you can run and feel like a child and then go explore. Listen to music while you do it.</p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    <p><strong>Take a bath</strong></p>

                    <p>Try different oils, essential oils and herbs, throw in a bunch of flowers and make it smell like the most luxurious bath in the world. If you get bored while taking baths, a nice drink and a good book or movie are a good addition.</p>
                    &nbsp;
                    <p><strong>Declutter</strong></p>

                    <p>There is no better feeling than simplifying and getting rid of the things we don't need because we make more space for the things we love.</p>

                    <p>Decluttering books we can highly recommend are: <a href="http://fave.co/2kvIuUc">The Curated </a><a href="http://fave.co/2kvIuUc">Closet</a> and <a href="http://fave.co/2kH1bGM">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a></p>
                    &nbsp;
                    <p><strong>Create a piece of art</strong></p>

                    <p>But without restrictions and a lot of color. Photograph, sing, sew, draw, write, practice a play.</p> &nbsp;

                    <p><strong>Read a book</strong></p>

                    <p>But not the book that you've been storing away for too long, the one you should read but never really felt like reading. Go to the library and stroll through your favorite sections, or find out what your favorite sections are. Find a book that really interests you in the moment and bring it to a place you always wanted to read in.</p>
                    &nbsp;
                    <p><strong>Write a letter</strong></p>

                    <p>But not one of those fast impatient letters we are used to. Write one that comes from the heart. A letter that means more than the words in it.</p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    <p><strong>Meet a friend</strong></p>

                    <p>Preferably at their place or at a coffee shop so you'll have to go outside and look presentable and don't have the stress of having to entertain. Sometimes a good conversation is all we need to give us perspective.</p>
                    &nbsp;
                    <p><strong>Visit family</strong></p>

                    <p>Being with my family sometimes helps to feel at ease, comfortable and taken care of and it is the perfect way to rejuvenate after a stressful time.</p>
                    &nbsp;

                    <p><strong>Go and see a movie</strong></p>

                    <p>Bring your own snacks and make it a special day. We like to bring sushi in a reusable container and our favorite drink in a reusable bottle.</p>

                    &nbsp;
                    <p><strong>Force yourself</strong></p>

                    <p>This might seem counterproductive but sometimes all we need is a kick in the butt to get started.</p>&nbsp;

                    <p>Sometimes even doing something good for our bodies seems like too much effort, which makes it necessary to occasionally force ourselves to do something good for ourselves.</p>&nbsp;
