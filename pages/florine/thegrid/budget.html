                        </header>
                        With uni books and stationary, housing, food and the occasional night out, it can get difficult to find your way thought the jungle of finance and budgeting. &nbsp;
                        <p>We've created a budgeting checklist with 10 tips of what you could do to save money, so that at the end of the day, you end up with surplus that could go into your savings.</p>
                        &nbsp;
                        <ul class="bullets">
                            <li><strong>Download a budgeting app</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>We really like the app <a href="http://wally.me/">Wally</a> for that, as it keeps a fantastic oversight of all our current spending and even has a function to put you on a budget an calculate your daily spendings to achieve that goal.</p>&nbsp;

                        <ul class="bullets">
                            <li><strong>Automate your savings</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>We think that every budget should include putting something in your savings account. Depending on your monthly income, you can automate the amount you would like to save every month and have it taken straight from your regular spending account, so you won't ever see and, therefore, won't ever miss the money.</p>
                        &nbsp;
                        <ul class="bullets">
                            <li><strong>Pay off the balance of your credit card each month</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Leaving your credit card bill unpaid for a longer period of time can not only ruin your mood, it is also really bad for your credit, which is an important factor if you want get a bank loan in the future.</p>

                            <img src="image/budget3.jpg" alt="bun"></div>
                        <ul class="bullets">
                            <li><strong>Spend your money on quality items</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>This might seem counter intuitive, as quality things might, in the beginning, cost more. Let me explain it with a personal story. When I started my higher educational program, Granpa Hofmann would always say: "You are too poor for cheap things now", meaning that if I wanted to save money, I needed to invest in things that would last me a long time and that I would get great value of.</p>
                        &nbsp;
                        <ul class="bullets">
                            <li><strong>Speak your mind</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Another great budgeting tip inspired by Grandpa Hofmann's advice is to say no to activities when you know you can't afford them. There is no shame in wanting to save and as Grandpa Hofmann would say: "It's either open your mouth or open your wallet".</p>
