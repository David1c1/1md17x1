            <section>

                <h6 class="first">Aarhus the city that’s just the right size, not too big, not too little, just right. Walking around you get too see the architecture of the city, a mixture off old and new accompanied by smiling locals and curious turists.</h6>
                
                <img src="images/studsgade540px.webp" alt="mural">

                <p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span> cosy town in the heart of Denmark and it’s also Europe’s Capital of Culture now in 2017. The city is full of events, art, musicians and installations. It feels like a playground for travellers and Denmark fans. Besides the events, there are also permanent things restaurants and of course – Danish pastries and exhibitions.
                </p>

                <p><i>When you live somewhere your surroundings start to become your everyday life, and you stop paying attention to whats happening around you, you instead start to ignore it, which might mean you don’t notice all the small things. </i></p>

                <img src="images/d.jpg"  alt="cobblestone-street">

                <p>The average age of the population in the city is younger than other cities — thanks to the schools. There are 35,000 students in the city and a part of us are the international students, students who have just moved to the city and are still trying to get to know it and finding their own favourite places. And that's what one should do.

            <h2>Aarhus from a different perspective</h2>
            <section>
                <h6 class="first">Diverse, modern and fun are words that describe Aarhus. Words that you hear and read when you want more info about the city, but being a student here means you have time to discover more off the city than just the main attractions.</h6>

                <img src="images/river800x600.jpg" alt="river">

                <p><span class="firstcharacter">W</span>here can I find the best coffee? Where can I go eat cheap food? Where, When, What? Trying to google these things won't really get you that far. The top search result will mostlikely be <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g189530-Activities-Aarhus_East_Jutland_Jutland.html">Tripadvisor.</a> But to get a result that is actually good your best bet would be to ask a local, and how does one find one you may ask? </p>

                <p><i>“It’s great seeing how something I think is normal and boring is so fun and impressive in someone else’s eyes.”</i></p>

                <p>You know you found a Dane when you can’t really understand them and then they crack a sarcastic Danish joke. In Aarhus you find all types of people and a big part of those people are locals who have lived in the city their whole life.</p>

                <img src="images/a_1.jpg" alt="cityhall">
                <h6 class="first">Step back, take a deep breath and look at something with a different perspective than normal. 
                </h6>

                <p>Being a local means you have a different perspective off the city and the endless possibilities. So for someone who doesn’t know that much it might help to talk to locals as a way to learn more about the city as well as to get to know their way of life and the culture. Learn and teach at the same time.</p>

                <p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span>arhus is a mix of young and old. It is one of Denmark's oldest cities and there is plenty to see for the one who is interested in history. Aarhus dates back to the 700's when Vikings settled down at the place where the cathedral stands today. If you want to know more about vikings, visit the Moesgård Museum, which also has a lot to offer. The most popular attraction is the Old Town, where you can experience a Danish city like it looked 100 years ago. Other interesting museums include the City Museum and Natural History.</p>
                
                <p>If historical museums aren't your thing, you have ARoS that is a modern 10-story image and experience house with cool architecture and exhibitions with works by many great artists. And you have a pretty great view from the top.
