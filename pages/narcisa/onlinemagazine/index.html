                    <h3 class="brand">1. Brand Identity Designer</h3>
                    <p>The brand designer provides new and innovative ways to combine images and words to express the main message of a company. This often involves modernizing the visual image of the company in terms of logo, tagline, typography, color palette, design, etc., while remaining close to the core of the brand and what it stands for.</p>
                    <p> Brand identity is more intricate than logo creation.It is the visual element that represents how a company wants to be seen. It is the company’s visual identity or “image.” Brand identity design helps consumers remember the company and is often what brings them back.</p>
                        <p>The right brand identity design can be the company’s strongest marketing tool. It translates the values and strategic vision of a company into a consistent image that consumers become familiar with.
